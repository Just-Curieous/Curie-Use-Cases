## Key Findings

1. **Fine-tuning Strategy**: Last-layer-only fine-tuning consistently outperformed full fine-tuning in terms of validation loss and computational efficiency.

2. **Early Peak Performance**: Models reach their best validation performance relatively early (around epochs 2-8) and then begin to overfit with continued training.

3. **Model Architecture**: ResNet50 showed the best performance-to-compute ratio among tested architectures.

4. **Data Augmentation**: Basic augmentation was sufficient for good results, with limited evidence that enhanced augmentation substantially improved performance.

5. **Resolution**: Standard 224x224 resolution performed adequately, with limited indication that higher resolutions provided significant benefits.

6. **Training Efficiency**: Last-layer-only fine-tuning with early stopping (2-3 epochs) provided the most efficient training approach.

## Best Configuration

Based on all experiments, the most efficient and effective configuration is:

- **Model Architecture**: ResNet50
- **Fine-tuning**: Last layer only
- **Data Augmentation**: Basic (horizontal flip, rotation)
- **Optimizer**: Adam
- **Learning Rate**: 0.001
- **Training Duration**: 2-3 epochs
- **Resolution**: 224x224
- **Early Stopping**: Fixed at epoch 3 (or earlier)

This configuration achieves approximately 77% validation accuracy with a validation loss of 0.74, training in under 2 minutes. The early stopping prevents overfitting that occurs with longer training durations.

## Recommendations for Future Work

1. **Ensemble Methods**: The results suggest that lightweight ensemble methods combining predictions from models trained with different initializations could improve performance.

2. **Alternative Architectures**: While ResNet50 performed well, testing more modern architectures like EfficientNetV2 or Vision Transformers with similar optimization settings could yield improvements.

3. **Test-time Augmentation**: Adding test-time augmentation could potentially improve prediction robustness.

4. **Cross-validation**: Implementing k-fold cross-validation would provide more robust performance estimates and potentially better generalization.
