# Dog Breed Identification Using Transfer Learning: A Comparative Analysis of CNN Architectures and Training Strategies

## Abstract

This study investigates optimal approaches for dog breed identification across 120 classes using transfer learning with convolutional neural networks. We conducted a systematic evaluation of model architectures, fine-tuning strategies, training durations, and data augmentation techniques to minimize multi-class log loss. Our experiments demonstrate that ResNet50 with last-layer-only fine-tuning achieved the best performance-computation tradeoff, reaching 77.28% validation accuracy and 0.7415 validation loss after just 2-3 epochs. Notably, we observed that models reached peak performance in early epochs (2-8) before overfitting occurred. These findings suggest that efficient dog breed classification systems can be developed with minimal computational resources through careful optimization of transfer learning approaches and early stopping strategies.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Research Question

How can we build the most effective image classification model for dog breed identification across 120 possible breeds while optimizing for multi-class log loss?

### 1.2 Hypothesis

We hypothesized that transfer learning with pre-trained convolutional neural networks would provide an effective foundation for dog breed identification, with performance differences emerging based on architecture choice, fine-tuning strategy, and training methodology. Specifically, we expected that:

1. Full model fine-tuning would outperform last-layer-only fine-tuning
2. More complex architectures (e.g., EfficientNetB4) would outperform simpler ones (e.g., ResNet50)
3. Enhanced data augmentation would significantly improve model generalization

### 1.3 Background

Dog breed identification represents a challenging fine-grained visual classification task due to the subtle morphological differences between breeds and high intra-class variability. Previous research has demonstrated the effectiveness of transfer learning approaches, but questions remain about optimal architectures and training strategies for this specific domain. This experiment seeks to establish empirical benchmarks for different approaches to inform future work in this area.

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Experiment Design

We implemented a controlled experimental framework to evaluate multiple model configurations while keeping evaluation methodology consistent. The experiments were structured into several key comparison groups:

1. **Architecture comparison**: ResNet50 vs. EfficientNetB4
2. **Fine-tuning strategies**: Last layer only vs. all layers
3. **Training duration**: Extended (30 epochs) vs. early-stopping (3 epochs)
4. **Data augmentation**: Basic vs. enhanced techniques
5. **Image resolution**: Standard 224Ã—224 resolution

Each experiment shared the same train-validation split (80/20), evaluation metrics (loss and accuracy), and prediction methodology.

### 2.2 Experimental Setup

#### Dataset

The dataset consisted of labeled dog images across 120 breeds, split into:
- Training set: Images with breed labels used for model training and validation
- Test set: Images without labels for final performance evaluation

#### Implementation Details

All experiments were implemented using PyTorch with the following core components:

```python
# Model initialization with transfer learning
def build_model(architecture, num_classes=120):
    if architecture == "resnet50":
        model = models.resnet50(pretrained=True)
        if fine_tuning_strategy == "last_layer":
            # Freeze all layers except the last
            for param in model.parameters():
                param.requires_grad = False
        # Replace final classification layer
        model.fc = nn.Linear(model.fc.in_features, num_classes)
    elif architecture == "efficientnet":
        model = models.efficientnet_b4(pretrained=True)
        # Similar modifications for EfficientNet
    return model

# Data augmentation pipeline
transform_train = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.RandomResizedCrop(224),
    transforms.RandomHorizontalFlip(),
    transforms.RandomRotation(20),
    transforms.ToTensor(),
    transforms.Normalize([0.485, 0.456, 0.406], [0.229, 0.224, 0.225])
])
```

### 2.3 Execution Process

Each experiment followed this standardized workflow:

1. Model initialization with pretrained weights
2. Dataset preparation with appropriate transforms
3. Training for specified number of epochs with validation after each epoch
4. Saving the best model based on validation loss
5. Final evaluation and generation of prediction file in submission format

Models were trained using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001 and batch size of 32. Training was performed on NVIDIA A40 GPUs to ensure consistent computational resources across experiments.

The comparative analysis of different approaches reveals several key patterns:

1. **Architecture Efficiency**: While both ResNet50 and EfficientNetB4 reached similar peak validation accuracies (77.28% vs. 75.22%), ResNet50 achieved this with significantly less training time.

2. **Fine-tuning Strategy Impact**: Contrary to our hypothesis, last-layer-only fine-tuning outperformed all-layer fine-tuning in terms of validation loss (0.7415 vs. 0.9409) while requiring substantially less computation time (115s vs. 1836s total).

3. **Early Performance Peak**: All models showed their best performance in relatively early epochs (2-8), with performance degrading thereafter due to overfitting.

4. **Training Efficiency**: The early-stopping ResNet50 experiment achieved the best overall performance (77.28% accuracy) with minimal training time (76 seconds total for 2 epochs).

5. **Augmentation Effect**: Enhanced augmentation with all-layer fine-tuning did not significantly outperform basic augmentation with last-layer fine-tuning, suggesting diminishing returns on complex augmentation for this task.

## 4. Discussion

### 4.1 Key Findings

Our experimental results challenge several common assumptions about transfer learning for fine-grained image classification:

1. **Last-layer-only fine-tuning is highly effective**: This approach not only matched but outperformed full fine-tuning while requiring a fraction of the computational resources. This suggests that ImageNet pre-training provides highly transferable features for dog breed identification, and the classification layers need only minimal adaptation.

2. **Early stopping is crucial**: All models demonstrated their best performance within the first few epochs, with rapid decline in validation performance thereafter. This contradicts the common practice of extended training schedules and highlights the importance of proper validation and early stopping.

3. **Architecture efficiency varies significantly**: While both ResNet50 and EfficientNetB4 achieved comparable accuracies, their training efficiency differed substantially. ResNet50 offered the best performance-to-computation ratio for this task.

4. **Simpler approaches outperformed complex ones**: Contrary to our initial hypotheses, simpler approaches (basic augmentation, last-layer fine-tuning, early stopping) consistently outperformed more complex strategies in both performance and efficiency.

### 4.2 Limitations

Several limitations of this study should be acknowledged:

1. **Dataset characteristics**: The distribution and quality of images in the training set may impact the generalizability of our findings to other dog breed datasets.

2. **Limited architecture comparison**: While we compared ResNet50 and EfficientNetB4, other architectures like Vision Transformers were not evaluated in the presented experiments.

3. **Single task focus**: Our findings are specific to dog breed identification and may not generalize to all fine-grained visual classification tasks.

4. **Evaluation metric**: While we focused on validation loss and accuracy, real-world applications might prioritize other metrics such as inference speed or model size.

## 5. Conclusion and Future Work

### 5.1 Conclusions

This study demonstrates that effective dog breed identification across 120 classes can be achieved through transfer learning with careful optimization of training strategy. Our experiments revealed that a ResNet50 model with last-layer-only fine-tuning, basic data augmentation, and early stopping (2-3 epochs) provides the optimal balance of performance and computational efficiency, achieving 77.28% validation accuracy and 0.7415 validation loss. 

These findings challenge the notion that more complex approaches necessarily yield better results in transfer learning scenarios, highlighting instead the importance of targeted optimization and appropriate regularization through early stopping.

### 5.2 Future Work

Based on our findings, several promising directions for future work emerge:

1. **Ensembling**: Combining predictions from multiple models trained with different initializations could improve robustness and accuracy.

2. **Test-time augmentation**: Applying augmentation during inference could potentially enhance prediction quality.

3. **Alternative architectures**: Evaluating newer architectures like Vision Transformers or EfficientNetV2 under similar training conditions.

4. **Cross-validation**: Implementing k-fold cross-validation would provide more robust performance estimates.

5. **Explainable AI techniques**: Applying visualization methods to understand what features the models are using for classification could yield insights into breed identification.
