Help me develop a machine learning model for predicting stock returns using historical factors.
Help me find the best ensemble methods combining predictions from models trained with different loss functions could outperform the baseline solution.


My current solution:
- Uses LightGBM regression to predict stock returns
- Trains on historical factor data (multiple features)
- Applies a rolling window approach (training on previous N years to predict next year)
- Uses rank correlation as the main evaluation metric
- Stock data is downloaded, which you can directly use.
