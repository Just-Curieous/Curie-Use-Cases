## Enhanced Data Processing Approaches:

1. **Feature Scaling**:
```python
def scale_features(factors):
    """Standardize features using z-score normalization."""
    scaled_factors = []
    
    for factor in factors:
        # Compute mean and std for each factor
        mean = factor.mean(axis=1)
        std = factor.std(axis=1)
        
        # Standardize
        scaled_factor = factor.sub(mean, axis=0).div(std, axis=0)
        scaled_factors.append(scaled_factor)
    
    return scaled_factors
```

2. **Outlier Handling**:
```python
def handle_outliers(factors, method='clip', threshold=3):
    """Handle outliers in the data."""
    processed_factors = []
    
    for factor in factors:
        if method == 'clip':
            # Clip values beyond threshold standard deviations
            mean = factor.mean()
            std = factor.std()
            factor_clipped = factor.clip(mean - threshold * std, mean + threshold * std)
            processed_factors.append(factor_clipped)
        elif method == 'winsorize':
            # Winsorize at specified percentiles
            lower = factor.quantile(0.01)
            upper = factor.quantile(0.99)
            factor_winsorized = factor.clip(lower, upper)
            processed_factors.append(factor_winsorized)
    
    return processed_factors
```

3. **Time-Based Feature Engineering**:
```python
def create_time_features(factors):
    """Create time-based features like moving averages."""
    enhanced_factors = []
    
    for factor in factors:
        # Moving averages
        ma_5 = factor.rolling(window=5).mean()
        ma_20 = factor.rolling(window=20).mean()
        
        # Rate of change
        roc = factor.pct_change()
        
        # Combine features
        enhanced_factors.extend([factor, ma_5, ma_20, roc])
    
    return enhanced_factors
```

4. **Cross-Sectional Normalization**:
```python
def cross_sectional_normalize(factors):
    """Normalize factors cross-sectionally (across stocks) for each day."""
    normalized_factors = []
    
    for factor in factors:
        # Rank normalization
        normalized = factor.rank(axis=1, pct=True)
        normalized_factors.append(normalized)
    
    return normalized_factors
```
