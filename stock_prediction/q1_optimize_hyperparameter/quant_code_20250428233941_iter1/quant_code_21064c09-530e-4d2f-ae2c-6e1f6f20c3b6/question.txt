# Prompt for Stock Return Prediction Optimization

I've developed a machine learning model for predicting stock returns using historical factors. My current implementation uses LightGBM with a rolling window approach. I'd like your help exploring various optimization strategies to improve my model's performance.

## Current Implementation Details

My model:
- Uses LightGBM regression to predict stock returns
- Trains on historical factor data (multiple features)
- Applies a rolling window approach (training on previous N years to predict next year)
- Uses rank correlation as the main evaluation metric
- Implements ensemble learning by averaging multiple model predictions
- Stock data is downloaded and included in the code, which you can directly use without additional operations.
- Code instructions can be found in README.md

## Areas for Optimization

Please help me explore the following areas to optimize prediction performance:

### 1. Feature Engineering and Selection
- Feature importance analysis and selection methods
- Feature transformation techniques (log, power, rank, etc.)
- Feature interaction and polynomial features
- Time-based feature creation (momentum, trend, volatility indicators)
- Dimensionality reduction (PCA, t-SNE, UMAP, etc.)
- Handling of outliers and missing data

### 2. Model Architecture
- Alternative models beyond LightGBM (XGBoost, CatBoost, Random Forest, Neural Networks)
- Hyperparameter optimization approaches
- Ensemble methods (stacking, blending, voting)
- Multi-level models (separate models for different market regimes)
- Time series specific approaches (ARIMA, Prophet, etc.)
- Deep learning architectures for time series (LSTM, GRU, Transformers)

### 3. Training Methodology
- Cross-validation strategies for time series
- Dynamic vs. fixed training window sizes
- Weighting of training samples (recent data more important?)
- Handling class imbalance if using classification approach
- Regularization techniques
- Adaptive learning rates and schedules

### 4. Evaluation Framework
- Alternative metrics beyond rank correlation
- Portfolio construction simulation and backtest
- Robustness testing across different market regimes
- Out-of-sample testing approaches
- Evaluation of prediction stability over time

### 5. Data Preprocessing
- Stock filtering criteria optimization
- Normalization/standardization approaches
- Outlier handling methods
- Missing data imputation techniques
- Data augmentation possibilities

### 6. Market Regime Analysis
- Market state detection and conditioning
- Sector/industry-specific models
- Volatility regime consideration
- Macro environment incorporation

### 7. Advanced Techniques
- Online learning / incremental learning approaches
- Transfer learning possibilities
- Bayesian optimization for hyperparameters
- Meta-learning approaches
- Reinforcement learning for dynamic strategy adjustment
- Explainable AI techniques for model interpretation

### 8. Implementation Efficiency
- Computation optimization (distributed training, GPU acceleration)
- Data pipeline optimization
- Model serving and inference optimization
