# Experimental Report: Optimizing Loss Functions for Stock Return Prediction Using LightGBM

## Title and Abstract

### Optimizing LightGBM Loss Functions for Enhanced Stock Return Rank Correlation

**Abstract:** This study evaluated various loss functions in LightGBM to determine the optimal choice for stock return prediction tasks where rank correlation is the primary performance metric. Using a rolling window approach on historical factor data from 2017-2023, we systematically compared standard loss functions (regression_l2, regression_l1, huber, fair, mape) alongside attempts to implement custom rank correlation objectives. Results show the mape loss function marginally outperformed other options with an overall rank correlation of 0.0921, compared to 0.0916 for the standard regression_l2 loss. Performance consistency was observed across different prediction years, with 2020 consistently showing the strongest correlations and 2022 the weakest. The study demonstrates that while loss function selection offers incremental improvements, the differences between standard loss functions are modest.

## 1. Introduction

### Research Question
Can alternative loss functions in LightGBM improve rank correlation performance for stock return prediction tasks compared to the standard mean squared error (regression_l2) approach?

### Hypothesis
Custom objective functions directly optimizing for rank correlation will outperform standard loss functions for stock return prediction tasks where ranking accuracy is more important than absolute prediction errors.

### Background
Stock return prediction models typically use mean squared error (MSE) as their default loss function during training. However, in many financial applications, the accurate ranking of stocks by expected returns is more important than the absolute accuracy of the return predictions themselves. This is particularly relevant for portfolio construction strategies that select top-ranked stocks or implement long-short strategies based on return rankings.

LightGBM, a gradient boosting framework known for its efficiency and flexibility, offers multiple standard loss functions and allows for custom objective functions. This experiment aimed to determine whether alternative loss functions could better optimize for rank correlation in stock return predictions, potentially improving portfolio performance without requiring more complex model architectures or additional data.

## 2. Methodology

### Experiment Design
The experiment was designed as a controlled comparison of different loss functions within the LightGBM framework, keeping all other variables constant. The control group used the standard regression_l2 (MSE) loss function, while experimental groups tested alternative loss functions.

#### Independent Variables:
- Loss function implementations:
  - Control group: regression_l2 (MSE)
  - Experimental groups: regression_l1 (MAE), huber, fair, mape, poisson, and quantile

#### Dependent Variables:
- Primary metric: Rank correlation between predicted and actual stock returns
- Secondary metrics: Mean Squared Error, training time

#### Control Variables:
- Data preprocessing steps
- Feature set (historical factors)
- Rolling window size (3 years)
- Ensemble learning approach (averaging multiple model predictions)

### Experimental Setup

**Data**:
- Stock return and factor data from 2017-2023
- Stocks filtered for minimum samples (1650), trading volume (5M), and price ($2)

**Rolling Window Implementation**:
- Training on 3 consecutive years of data
- Predicting returns for the following year
- Moving the window forward one year at a time
- Prediction years: 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023

**Model Configuration**:
- LightGBM with 511 leaves
- Learning rate: 0.02
- Subsample and colsample: 0.7
- Early stopping based on validation performance
- Ensemble approach: 3 simulations per prediction year

**Loss Functions Tested**:
1. regression_l2 (MSE): Standard mean squared error
2. regression_l1 (MAE): Mean absolute error
3. huber (delta=1.0): Hybrid of L1 and L2, more robust to outliers
4. fair (c=1.0): Similar to Huber but with smooth transitions
5. mape: Mean Absolute Percentage Error
6. poisson: Poisson regression loss (attempted but not completed)
7. quantile (alpha=0.5): Quantile regression (attempted but not completed)

### Implementation Details
The experiment was implemented using Python with LightGBM as the core modeling library. A custom framework was developed to:
1. Configure and train models with different loss functions
2. Maintain consistent data preprocessing and feature engineering
3. Track performance metrics across prediction years
4. Generate ensemble predictions
5. Calculate and compare rank correlations

Code modifications were required to properly configure different loss functions within the LightGBM framework and ensure metrics were calculated consistently. GPU acceleration was enabled using OpenCL to maximize training efficiency.

### Execution Progress
The experiment proceeded in several phases:

1. **Control Group Execution**: The baseline model using regression_l2 was successfully trained and evaluated, establishing benchmark performance metrics.

2. **Standard Loss Function Evaluation**: Models using regression_l1, huber, fair, and mape loss functions were successfully trained and evaluated.

3. **Advanced Loss Function Attempts**: Efforts to implement poisson and quantile loss functions were made but not fully completed.

4. **Custom Objective Function Exploration**: Initial attempts were made to implement custom objective functions directly optimizing rank correlation, but these were not fully completed due to implementation challenges.

5. **Verification Testing**: Additional verification experiments were performed to confirm that LightGBM correctly applied the configured loss functions during training.

### Challenges Encountered
Several technical challenges were encountered during the experimentation:

1. **Environment Configuration Issues**: Initial permission issues and dependency errors required troubleshooting before experiments could proceed.

2. **Data Path Problems**: Some experiments attempted to access incorrect data paths, requiring configuration corrections.

3. **Loss Function Implementation**: Ensuring that LightGBM correctly applied the specified loss functions required verification testing to confirm proper implementation.

4. **Custom Objective Implementation**: Developing custom objectives to directly optimize rank correlation proved challenging due to the need for differentiable approximations of rank metrics.

5. **Results Isolation**: Ensuring proper isolation between experiments required careful management of output directories and configuration files.

## 3. Results

### Standard Loss Function Performance

The following table summarizes the rank correlation performance of the successfully tested loss functions:

| Loss Function    | Overall Corr | 2020    | 2021    | 2022    | 2023    |
|------------------|-------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| regression_l2    | 0.0916      | 0.1075  | 0.0880  | 0.0810  | 0.0903  |
| regression_l1    | 0.0914      | 0.1084  | 0.0871  | 0.0818  | 0.0886  |
| huber            | 0.0919      | 0.1069  | 0.0878  | 0.0829  | 0.0904  |
| mape             | 0.0921      | 0.0982  | 0.0885  | 0.0874  | 0.0943  |

**Performance Analysis:**
1. **Overall Performance**: All tested loss functions achieved similar overall rank correlation values, ranging from 0.0914 to 0.0921. The mape loss function showed a very slight advantage with an overall correlation of 0.0921.

2. **Year-by-Year Performance**: 
   - 2020 generally showed the strongest correlations across all loss functions.
   - 2022 showed the weakest correlations for most loss functions.
   - The mape loss function showed more consistent performance across years, with less variation between strongest and weakest years.

3. **Relative Comparisons**:
   - The huber loss (0.0919) slightly outperformed the standard regression_l2 loss (0.0916)
   - The regression_l1 loss (0.0914) slightly underperformed the standard regression_l2 loss
   - The mape loss showed the best overall performance, but by a very small margin

### Verification Results

Verification experiments confirmed that LightGBM correctly used the configured loss functions during training. For example, setting the objective to "huber" with huber_delta=1.0 resulted in the model correctly using the Huber loss function with the specified parameter value, as evidenced by the model's booster parameters containing:

```python
booster_params = {
    "objective": "huber",
    "huber_delta": 1.0
}
```

### Advanced and Custom Loss Functions

Attempts to implement poisson, quantile, and custom rank correlation objectives were not fully completed during the experimental timeframe. These remain areas for future investigation.

## 4. Conclusion and Future Work

### Summary of Findings

1. **Marginal Differences Between Loss Functions**: The experiment revealed only small differences in rank correlation performance between the standard loss functions tested. The mape loss function showed the best overall performance with a correlation of 0.0921, representing only a 0.55% improvement over the standard regression_l2 loss (0.0916).

2. **Performance Stability Across Years**: All loss functions showed similar patterns of performance across prediction years, with 2020 generally yielding the strongest correlations and 2022 the weakest. This suggests that market conditions in different years may have a stronger influence on prediction performance than the choice of loss function.

3. **Hypothesis Evaluation**: The experiment does not provide strong evidence to support the hypothesis that alternative loss functions would significantly outperform the standard regression_l2 loss for rank correlation tasks. While some minor improvements were observed with mape and huber loss functions, the differences were marginal.

4. **Practical Implications**: For stock return prediction tasks focused on ranking, the choice between standard loss functions appears to have only incremental effects on performance. This suggests that practitioners might focus more on feature engineering, model architecture, or ensemble approaches rather than loss function optimization for significant performance gains.

### Recommendations for Future Work

1. **Complete Evaluation of Advanced Loss Functions**: Fully implement and evaluate the poisson and quantile loss functions that were not completed in this experiment.

2. **Custom Rank Correlation Objectives**: Develop and test differentiable approximations of rank correlation metrics that can be directly optimized during model training.

3. **Two-Stage Training Approach**: Explore a two-stage training process where models are first trained with standard loss functions and then fine-tuned to optimize rank correlation directly.

4. **Feature Engineering Focus**: Investigate whether more sophisticated feature engineering approaches might yield larger performance improvements than loss function optimization.

5. **Ensemble Method Exploration**: Test whether ensemble methods combining predictions from models trained with different loss functions could outperform any single loss function approach.

6. **Hyperparameter Optimization**: Conduct hyperparameter optimization for the best-performing loss functions to determine if their advantages can be further amplified through better parameter settings.

7. **Extended Time Periods**: Expand the analysis to include more years of historical data to test whether the loss function performance patterns hold across different market regimes.

### Final Thoughts

The results of this experiment suggest that while the choice of loss function in LightGBM can influence rank correlation performance for stock return prediction, the differences between standard loss functions are modest. The mape and huber loss functions showed slight advantages over the standard regression_l2 loss, but the magnitude of improvement may not justify significant implementation effort in many practical scenarios.

This study highlights the robustness of LightGBM across different loss function configurations and suggests that for significant performance improvements in stock return prediction tasks, researchers and practitioners may need to look beyond simple loss function substitutions to more fundamental aspects of model design and data representation.
