Help me develop a machine learning model for predicting stock returns using historical factors. My current implementation uses LightGBM with a rolling window approach. I'd like your help exploring various optimization strategies to improve my model's performance in terms of rank correlation.

My current solution:
- Uses LightGBM regression to predict stock returns
- Trains on historical factor data (multiple features)
- Applies a rolling window approach (training on previous N years to predict next year)
- Uses rank correlation as the main evaluation metric
- Implements ensemble learning by averaging multiple model predictions
- Stock data is downloaded, which you can directly use.

Please help me explore the following area to optimize prediction performance:

Try to tune hyperparameters listed below for LightGBM model to find the best set of hyperparameters that gives best rank correlation.
