This repository provides a collection of use cases and examples demonstrating the application of the [Curie](https://github.com/Just-Curieous/Curie) for automated and rigorous scientific experimentation with AI agents.

## Overview

The Curie framework is designed to facilitate scientific discovery across various domains by automating the experimentation process. This repository contains specific implementations and experiments that showcase how Curie can be applied to different problems, particularly in machine learning and stock prediction.
