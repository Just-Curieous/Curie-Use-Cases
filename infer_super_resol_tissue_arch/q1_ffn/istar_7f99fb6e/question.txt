Find an optimal feedforward neural network predict high-resolution gene expression by allocating low-resolution spatial transcriptomics (ST) measurements to finer spatial units (superpixels) based on high-resolution histological features?
The objective is to minimize the loss or RMSE of the model. 
The baseline solution code is provided, you can just work on top of it. 
Refer to 'paper.pdf' for more context of this problem.
